*Welcome to Glimpse, a General Layer-wise IMage ProceSsing Engine!*

The Glimpse project [IJCNN2013]_ is a library for implementing hierarchical
visual models in C++ and Python. The goal of this project is to allow a
broad range of feed-forward, hierarchical models to be encoded in a
high-level declarative manner, with low-level details of the implementation
hidden from view. This project combines an efficient implementation with the
ability to leverage parallel processing facilities and is designed to run on
multiple operating systems using only common, freely-available components. A
prototype of Glimpse has been used to encode an `HMAX-like model
<http://www.pnas.org/content/104/15/6424.long>`_, achieving results
comparable with those found in the literature. The project has been
supported by NSF Grant 1018967 (PIs: Melanie Mitchell and Garrett Kenyon).

Source code_ and documentation_ are available for the project, as well as an
installable package_.
