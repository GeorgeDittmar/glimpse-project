GLIMPSE: The General Layer-wise IMage ProceSsing Engine

The GLIMPSE project is a library for implementing hierarchical visual models in
C++ and Python. The goal of this project is to allow a broad range of
feed-forward, hierarchical models to be encoded in a high-level declarative
manner, with low-level details of the implementation hidden from view. GLIMPSE
combines an efficient implementation with the ability to leverage parallel
processing facilities and is designed to run on multiple operating systems using
only common, freely-available components. A prototype of GLIMPSE has been used
to encode an HMAX-like model, achieving results comparable with those found in
the literature.

The GLIMPSE library began as a port of the Petascale Artificial Neural Network
project [1], and owes a great deal to that work. Additionally, we acknowledge
NSF Grant 1018967 (PIs: Melanie Mitchell and Garrett Kenyon) for support.

============== DEPENDENCIES ===================

Assumes the following software is already installed.

python 2.x (at least 2.6)
pil (at least 1.1.7) -- for image I/O in Python
libjpeg -- to enable I/O of JPEG formatted images in PIL
numpy (at least 1.3.0) -- efficient array access in Python
scipy (at least 0.7.2) -- N-dimensional array interpolation
bash (at least 4.1.5) -- for experiment control scripts (many commands can still
        be run without this)
LIBSVM (at least 2.91) -- for building and applying SVM classification models
          (image transformations can still be applied without this)

Additionally, the following software is very useful.

IPython -- feature-rich interactive Python environment (great for investigating
           experimental results)
SVM-light -- alternative SVM package

Finally, the following software is useful for those working on Glimpse
development.

cython -- this project is used to glue together the C++ and Python code
google-perftools -- for profiling Python extensions written in C/C++
yep -- thin Python convenience layer around google-perftools

=============== INSTALL =======================

This project currently expects to be used in-place (i.e., not installed to the
system-wide python library). Thus, the install procedure is simply the
following.

  python setup.py build
  cd glimpse/core/
  ln -s ../../build/lib.*/glimpse/core/c_src.so

If you plan to run experiments using a support vector machine (SVM) as the
classifier, you must have either LIBSVM for SVM-light installed (i.e., on your
path).
