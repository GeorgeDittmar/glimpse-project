============== DEPENDENCIES ===================

Assumes the following software is already installed.

python 2.x (only tested on 2.6)
pil -- for image I/O in Python
  libjpeg -- to enable I/O of JPEG formatted images in PIL
numpy -- efficient array access in Python
bash -- for experiment control scripts (many commands can still be run without
        this)
LIBSVM -- for building and applying SVM classification models (image
          transformations can still be applied without this)

Additionally, the following software is very useful.

IPython -- feature-rich interactive Python environment (great for investigating
           experimental results)
SVM-light -- alternative SVM package

Finally, the following software is useful for those working on Glimpse development.

cython -- this project is used to glue together the C++ and Python code
google-perftools -- for profiling Python extensions written in C/C++
  yep -- thin Python convenience layer around google-perftools

=============== INSTALL =======================

This project currently expects to be used in-place (i.e., not installed to the
system-wide python library). Thus, the install procedure is simply the
following.

  python setup.py build
  cd glimpse/core/
  ln -s ../../build/lib.*/glimpse/core/c_src.so

If you plan to run experiments using a support vector machine (SVM) as the
classifier, you must have either LIBSVM for SVM-light installed (i.e., on your
path).
